## Description

Practice to build a 2D side scroll game using html, css and javascript.

## Controls

JUMP  
'W' 

LEFT  
'A' 

RIGHT       
'D' 

## _Notes 1.0_
 - To retry you'll need to reload.
 - State Hit doesn't provide Iframes.
 - States need more study so they are in progress.
 - State Rolling its a dominant feature which needs some rework.
 - Collision hitboxes aren't perfect fit to strokes & circles around characters on screen.
